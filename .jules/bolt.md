## 2026-03-31 — Caching Network API Calls

Learning:
When caching network-heavy API calls like `GoogleSearcher.search()`, caching the `Promise` immediately rather than awaiting the result effectively implements Promise Coalescing, preventing cache stampedes from concurrent identical requests.

Action:
Ensure rejected promises are caught and removed from the cache using `.catch()` or `try-catch` blocks within the async closure to prevent transient errors from being permanently cached. Do not commit temporary script files like `patch.js`.
